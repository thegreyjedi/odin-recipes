        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Make broth: Place beef bones in a 9-quart (or larger) pot; season with 1 teaspoon salt.<br>
                Pour water into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer broth for about 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.<br>
                Line a 10x15-inch roasting pan with aluminum foil.
            </li>
            <li>Place onions and unpeeled ginger onto the prepared roasting pan and cook under the preheated<br> 
                broiler, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are charred, 10 to 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Cool slightly. Chop onions, then peel and slice ginger; set aside separately.</li>
            <li>Skim fat from surface of simmering broth. Add oxtail, radish, and charred onions <br>
                to broth. Tie charred ginger, anise, cinnamon stick, peppercorns, and cloves in<br>
                cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni; add to broth. Stir in sugar, fish sauce, and remaining<br>
                2 teaspoons salt. Simmer over medium-low heat for at least 4 hours (the longer, the better).<br>
                Season with salt.</li>
            <li>Strain broth. Discard bones and bouquet garni. Reserve meat from bones for another use. Chill<br>
                broth in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.
            </li>
            <li>Skim and discard fat from the top of chilled broth. Pour broth into a pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and keep hot until ready to serve.
            </li>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Turn off heat. Stir in rice noodles and let sit until noodles are tender yet chewy, 6 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cut frozen sirloin into paper-thin slices</li>
            <li>Drain and divide noodles among bowls, about 1 1/2 cups per serving. Top each with a few sirloin slices. Ladle hot broth over sirloin and noodles.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
